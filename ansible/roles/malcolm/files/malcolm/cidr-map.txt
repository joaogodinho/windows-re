# CIDR to network segment format:
#   IP(s)|segment name|required tag
#
# where:
#   IP(s): comma-separated list of CIDR-formatted network IP addresses
#          e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, 169.254.0.0/16, 172.16.10.41
#
#   segment name: segment name to be assigned when event IP address(es) match
#
#   required tag (optional): only check match and apply segment name if the event
#                            contains this tag
#
#  Alternatively, as of Malcolm v2.0 there is a web UI editor for defining subnet
#  to segment name maps, located at https://<Malcolm IP>/name-map-ui.
