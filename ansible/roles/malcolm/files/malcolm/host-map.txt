# IP or MAC address to host name map:
#   address|host name|required tag
#
# where:
#   address: comma-separated list of IPv4, IPv6, or MAC addresses
#          e.g., 172.16.10.41, 02:42:45:dc:a2:96, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
#
#   host name: host name to be assigned when event address(es) match
#
#   required tag (optional): only check match and apply host name if the event
#                            contains this tag
#
#  Alternatively, as of Malcolm v2.0 there is a web UI editor for defining address
#  to host name maps, located at https://<Malcolm IP>/name-map-ui.
